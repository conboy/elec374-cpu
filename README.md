# elec374-cpu

The purpose of this project is to design, simulate, implement, and verify a simple RISC computer.
The design consists of a simple RISC processor, memory, and I/O. Intel Quartus Prime Design Software
and ModelSim-Intel are used for this purpose. The design is to be implemented on the Cyclone V chip
(5CEBA4F23C7) of the DE0-CV development board.
